sketchify.cpp was edited so that three errors were debugged out.

Methods of Debugging:
1) Print statements (cout << "line " << __LINE__ << ": x = " << x << endl;)
2) Command Line Debugger with these commands:
- run (r)                  # Run the program from start
- next (n)                 # Execute the next line of code
- step (s)                 # Step into function in current line
- continue (c)             # Continue until next break point
- break (b) <file:line>    # Set a breakpoint at the location
- backtrace (bt)           # Print function call stack, most recent first
- print (p) <expression>   # Evaluates and prints expression
- info locals              # Prints info about all local variables
- info args                # Prints info about all function arguments
- quit (q)                 # Quit GDB
3) Comparing image outputs:
- Using this command: compare out2.png given_imgs/out_2.png comparison.png
